## dependencies.science website

The website is built using 11ty.js. To install the dependencies, just run `npm install` inside this directory.

To run the website locally, run `npm start`. This will start a local server, and will watch for changes in the files.

Once you have commited all the changes you want to make, you must *manually* deploy the site by running the [Build Website GitHub Action](https://github.com/donald-pinckney/npm-follower/actions/workflows/build-website.yml).
